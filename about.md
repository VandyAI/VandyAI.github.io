At VandyAI, our founding vision was to demystify the technical realm of artificial intelligence and make it accessible to all members of the Vanderbilt University community. We are driven by a passion for exploring the depths of AI technology, from unraveling the complexities of conversational models like ChatGPT to pioneering the development of our own Stable Diffusion Models.
